# Find and share stories using data

We’ll learn how to find the stories within data and share them with our audience. We’ll learn about the methods and benefits of data cleaning and how it can help us discover those stories. We’ll also go over the steps of the EDA process and learn how EDA can help us quickly understand data. Finally, we'll explore different ways to visualize data to communicate key insights.

## Learning Objective

- Recognize the importance of ethics and accessibility in visualizing data
- Explain how EDA helps data professionals share stories from raw data sources
- Recognize the importance of ethics and accessibility in sharing stories with data
- Explain the process of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the benefits of understanding data
- Explain the importance of aligning EDA methods with business purposes while using the PACE framework
- Identify the six different parts of the EDA process: discovering, structuring, cleaning, joining, validating, presenting
- Explain how data analysis helps data professionals tell stories from raw data sources

# Explore raw data

Finding stories in data using EDA is all about organizing and interpreting raw data. Python can help us do this quickly and effectively. You’ll learn how to use Python to perform the EDA practices of discovering and sculpting.

## Learning objective

- Identify ethical issues that may come up during the data “discovering” practice of EDA
- Use Python to merge or join data based on defined criteria
- Use Python to sort and/or filter data
- Use relevant Python libraries for cleaning raw data
- Recognize opportunities for creating hypotheses based on raw data
- Recognize when and how to communicate status updates and questions to key stakeholders
- Apply Python tools to examine raw data structure and format.
- Use the PACE workflow to understand whether given data is adequate and applicable to a data science project
- Differentiate between the common formats of raw data sources (json, tabular, etc.) and data types

# Clean your data

We’ll explore three more EDA practices: cleaning, joining, and validating. You'll discover the importance of these practices for data analysis, and we’ll use Python to clean, validate, and join data.

## Learning Objective

- Apply input validation skills to a dataset with Python
- Explain the importance of input validation
- Demonstrate how to transform categorical data into numerical data with Python
- Explain the importance of categorical versus numerical data in a dataset
- Explain the importance of recognizing outliers in a dataset
- Demonstrate how to identify outliers in a dataset with Python
- Understand when to contact stakeholders or engineers regarding missing values
- Explain the importance of ethically considering missing values
- Demonstrate how to identify missing data with Python
