# 🧹 Data Cleaning in Python
A practical guide to fixing messy data in your datasets

# 📌 Overview
Data cleaning is one of the most essential—but often most frustrating—parts of data science.
- Why are some text fields garbled?
- What should we do about missing values?
- Why are dates so inconsistent?
- And how do we quickly fix messy data so we can move on to real analysis?

This notebook walks through the most common data cleaning problems and shows you step-by-step solutions to handle them efficiently and correctly.

# 🎯 What We Will Learn

## 🔧 1. Handling Missing Values
- Identifying missing data
- Strategies like dropping, imputing, or flagging
- Using pandas functions like isnull(), fillna(), and dropna()

## 📏 2. Scaling & Normalization
- Why scaling matters in machine learning
- When to use normalization vs. standardization
- Using tools like MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler

## 📅 3. Parsing Dates
- Converting strings into datetime objects
- Handling mixed date formats
- Extracting useful features like year, month, or day
- Fixing common errors when reading date columns

## 🔤 4. Character Encoding Issues
- Why some text gets garbled
- UTF-8 vs. Latin-1
- Fixing encoding errors while loading CSV files

## 🔁 5. Inconsistent Data Entry
- Detecting typos
- Cleaning categories
- Standardizing text using string methods
- Tools for quick data normalization

# 📂 Purpose of This Notebook
This notebook is designed to help us:
- Understand why data becomes messy
